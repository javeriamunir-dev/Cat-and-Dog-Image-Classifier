> 💡 **Tip:**  
> If any image doesn’t appear on GitHub, click the image in your repo → “Copy image address” → paste that full link inside `![Image](URL)` instead of `assets/...`

✅ **After uploading your images**, your README will show:
- A top banner 🎨  
- Graphs for accuracy & loss 📊  
- A confusion matrix image 🧮  

Would you like me to add one extra **“📊 Results Visualization Gallery”** layout — with all three images shown in one horizontal row (looks like a portfolio grid)? It looks very modern on GitHub.
